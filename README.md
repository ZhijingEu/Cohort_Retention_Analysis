# Cohort_Retention_Analysis
This repo is a code demo that implements a custom Customer Retention Analysis class with a number of helpful functions to generate customer churn insights frequently used for marketing analytics to understand the growth and change of an organisation's customer base (new vs retained vs lost)

This repo is accompanied by a Medium blog article "Analyzing Customer Retention Via Cohort Analysis" available at https://medium.com/p/1f381748e555

# About The Datasets
The code is implemented with two datasets:
1) The Sprocket Central Dataset is one year's worth of customer transaction records for a fictional company that makes bicycles and other associated products https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/archit9406/customer-transaction-dataset
2) The Online Retail II Dataset which is online retail transaction data set of two years from the year 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 for a UK based e-commerce company https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii
